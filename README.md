# AGM Food Delivery Project

## Introduction
AGM aims to expand its food delivery network in the Bay Area using BART for economic and environmental benefits. The project involves:
- Creating a Neo4j graph to represent BART stations as nodes.
- Designating sections of the Bay Area as clusters and identifying BART stations that can serve as cluster centers.
- Developing an algorithm to determine the shortest delivery paths to these cluster centers.
- Recommending the installation of AGM delivery pickup centers at key BART stations.

## Food Delivery Model
The proposed delivery model includes:
- Transporting food from AGM Berkeley to the nearest BART station (Downtown Berkeley).
- Loading food into an AGM-specific BART car.
- Unloading food at various hubs and storing it in AGM food storage lockers.
- Customers or partnering delivery services picking up the food from these lockers.
